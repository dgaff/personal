# Doug Gaff Mangaer Readme

Based on Matt Newkirk's [Manager Readme](https://mattnewkirk.com/2019/01/02/avoiding-mistakes-with-your-manager-readme/) this document is to help you get to know me as a manager. Matt says that manager readmes should 1) Share expectations to reduce a person's anxiety working with you and 2) Build trust as they get to know you. I would add that **I want you to know me as a person first, manager second**, and this document attempts to showcase that.

## Who cares about stats, who are you really?

I have five personal values that when kept in balance help me show up as my best self for others and also make me very happy personally.

1. Relationships
2. Humor
3. Adventure
4. Intellect
5. Achievement

My absolute favorite thing in the world is to have deep, thoughtful, personal conversations with other people. I believe strong interpersonal relationships on the foundation for everything, especially trust. I despise transactional relationships, both in work and in my personal life. This means I often struggle with people who are guarded and can't open up to others. I also find it more difficult to establish these relationhips over zoom or in remote work life. I try to do them, but it just takes longer than I want.

I love infusing humor into everything. This also translates better to in-person relationships. I haven't found as many ways to create humor in remote life, so usually estalbishing my humorous side in person first is how I extend it to remote work and life.

Adventure is how I reacharge (MORE)

Intellect 

Achievement 

## My flaws

I am very much not perfect, so I figured I should put this right up front. 

(maybe high expectations and frequent disappointment with others)
My number one flaw is that *I am very impatient.* This leads to having high and often unrealistic of myself and those around me. I try to keep this in check when working with others, often over-correcting by not pushing hard enough or by wo

Not enough drill sergeant in me.
Default implicit trust in others, which can sometimes lead to disappointment.
Impatient, which I overcorrect for.
Stubborn
