# Doug Gaff Mangaer Readme

Based on Matt Newkirk's [Manager Readme](https://mattnewkirk.com/2019/01/02/avoiding-mistakes-with-your-manager-readme/) this document is to help you get to know me as a manager. Matt says that manager readmes should 1) Share expectations to reduce a person's anxiety working with you and 2) Build trust as they get to know you. I would add that **I want you to know me as a person first, manager second**, and this document attempts to showcase that.
