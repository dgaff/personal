# Doug Gaff Manager Readme

Based on Matt Newkirk's [Manager Readme](https://mattnewkirk.com/2019/01/02/avoiding-mistakes-with-your-manager-readme/) this document is to help you get to know me as a manager. Matt says that manager readmes should 1) Share expectations to reduce a person's anxiety working with you and 2) Build trust as they get to know you. I would add that **I want you to know me as a person first, manager second**, and this document attempts to accomplish that.

## Who cares about stats, who are you really?

I was born outside of Chicago to parents from Indiana. My parents were 18 and 23 when I was born! I moved around a lot as a kid because of my Dad's career as an architect. We ended up in Roanoke, Virginia when I was a pre-teen, which is how I landed at Virginia Tech. My parents divorced when I was 10, and they're both remarried. While our ancestry is all from Indiana, my immediate and extended family now live all over the US. So there isn't one place any of us calls home anymore. I tell this story because living a lot of places and moving around a lot has deeply shaped who I am. 

My personal value words are *Relationships, Humor, Adventure, Intellect, Achievement*. When I am able to keep these five things in balance, they help me show up as my best self. When these feel out of balance, I am more stressed and don't show up as well to others. Here's more detail on these value words.

One of my favorite thing in the world is to have deep, thoughtful, personal conversations with other people. I believe strong interpersonal relationships on the foundation for everything good that happens. In the workplace, they are the foundation of trust. I don't enjoy transactional relationships, either in work or in my personal life. This means I frequently struggle with people who are guarded and can't open up to others. I also find it more difficult to establish meaningful relationhips over zoom or in remote work settings. I still try to do them, but it takes me longer.

I have a good sense of humor and love to laugh and have fun. My sense of humor can be irreverant at times, but you have to get to know me more intimately to see that side of me. My sense of humor translates much better to in-person relationships than remote life. Probably has something to do with comedic timing and being able to read a room. So learning to infuse humor when we are all on zoom all the time is something I'm still working on and haven't figure out.

Adventure is driving force of my life. As a shortcut, aventure to me means: explorer, naturist, and speed junkie. My hobbies list above covers several aspects of adventure. At this point in my life, I still enjoy the adrenaline rush of speed, and skiing and mountian biking help meet that need. Nature recharges me, so I try to get time outside almost daily. I like to travel, even for day trips of exploration. And I dream of one day flying a jet pack or a human-sized drone. I need to do this before I get too old and people say, "Doug, do you really think that's a good idea?" üòÑ

On the topic of intellect, I'm a smart and cerebral guy. It's not just book smarts or cool technical things, though. I like life wisdom. Not quite philosophy or religion, but more the study of humans and how we all interact. I am deeply curious about humans and humanity. I actually think this is really important to be a good manager.

When it comes to achievement, I have a lot of drive, both professionally and personally. I guess you can put me in the stererotypical high acheiver bucket. Why this is important...that's a conversation for us to have as we build a meaningful realtionship with each other. See also, House of Slytherin. 

Ok, one last thing. Ask me what I live for, and I'll tell you that I like to *build and belong*. Building means a lot of things. It means all things maker-related and goes back to my desire to be a mad scientist investor. Building alost means building my family, buildng relationships, building teams, bulding organizations, and building companies. I'm happy when I'm building. Beloging is about relationships: my family, my community, my friends, my extended tribe, and my company. 

## My flaws

So the last section is all üåà and ü¶Ñ. It's aspirational and my best self. But I'm a broken human like the rest of you. Here's how.

My number one flaw is that *I am impatient and stubborn*. This one is harder to see unless you get close to me, but you can ask my wife about this if you want. üòÅ In work, this translates to me sometimes being inflexible and sometimes being frustrated when things are taking too long or not coming to a clear conclusion.

My number two flaw is that *I often have unrealistic expectations of myself and those around me*. Related to achievement above, I'm never fully satisfied with my own work, and I'm always looking at ways I wish I had done things better. While a certain amount of this is good because it drives me to get better, it can also be unhealthy. I've worked on it for years with coaches, but I'm still not where I need to be. The weird thing about how this projects onto others is that sometimes I overcorrect for my expectations out of others and then struggle to push them because the narrative in my head sounds too much like being a jerk. Feedback is critical, though, and so I'm working hard to get better at dialing this to the right volume.

I have more flaws, but I think they are side effects of these two big ones. However, feel free to point them out. üòú

## What to expect from me & what I need from you

This section is organized by my leadership values. These values relate to how I will try to work with you. I won't always get this right, of course, but if I'm doing a good job, this is what you can expect.

### Honesty & Transparency

Perhaps you can tell from this readme, but I'm a very transparent person. I will be transparent with you, sometimes to a fault. I will tell you what I'm thinking. I will tell you what I'm worried about. Barring any legal or regulalatory issues, I will tell you what's going on at the company. 
  
* Talk to me about anything & everything.
* If you feel like you're failing, tell me. I might feel that way, too, but don't worry. I will work to support you to get you to a better spot.
* Fail as fast as you can, and then learn.
* Don't kiss my ass. I can see through it, and I won't believe you.

If you don't hear from me, it's not because I've abandoned you, it's likely because I'm swamped. My communication gets really poor when I'm overloaded.

Finally, *I hate politics, and I hate people who are in it for themselves.* Don't play politics with me. I will see through it, and if it happens more than a couple of times, I will write you off. 

### Empathy & Feedback

From the relationships discussion above, I hope you can see how empathy plays a big part in how I lead. I will give you a lot of rope to learn and grow, likely more than other managers have given you and sometimes more than whomever is my manager would like. This comes from my belief that everyone can grow and get better with the right feedback and growth mindset. So, if you're being transparent with me about what's working and not working for you, I will be more engaged in your success.

I will give you feedback. While we're getting to know each other, I want you to hear it as "I trust you and have confidence in you, so I'm telling you this to help you succeed." Hopefully it will sound exactly like that when I say it. I will still get frustrated sometimes, especially if I feel like you're not telling me everything. And of course, empathy doesn't mean that I won't hold you accountable. Empathy also means having a tough conversation about how a role might not be working out. 

I need empathy and feedback from you, too. I have a hard job that is frequently tiring. Sometimes I'm not at my best self. So if I seem frustrated, ask me what's going on. Ask me how I'm doing. When you give feedback to me, you don't need to sugar coat it. Just please try to be specific in your feedback and please be clear about what you need. 

Finally, ask me for pep talks. Personally, I need to get better at celebrating wins, and if you haven't gotten praise from me recently, please just ask for it. I'll deliver.

### Team Over Individual

I believe in the power of teams. Teams build the things our customers need. Teams solve the hard technical problems. Here's how I view teams.

Teams do:

* Take control and own their own destiny.
* Take care of each other, and hold each other accountable.
* Continuously learn and grow.
* Have fun!

Teams don't:

* Have egos
* Tolerate prima donnas
* Blame others
* Sulk in silence

I have to call out the prima donna point. I have no patience for special snowflakes. I don't believe in giving leeway to "brilliant jerks" just because they're brilliant. Smart people...10x engineers...these folks magnify the people around them. 

What I need from you here is simple: use all of your leadership skills to ensure the success of your teams.

### Collaborative Decisions

I like to hear everyone's input on important decisions. Usually this is good, but sometimes it can be slow. When I build teams, I find people who know more than I do. So I rely on my team to help with decisions. As an executive, this means I rely on my senior leaderhsip team for discussion and debate. If a clear decision emerges, we'll go with that. If there isn't one, I will try to make one.

This can be a point of weakness sometimes, as I am working to be more decisive. In reality, I have opnions on everything (see stubborness above), but I overcorrect for this by driving towards consensus. This can lead to me not making a needed crisp decision in the moment. You must call me out, "Doug, make the damn decision!" 

When you are working with your teams, I want you to get your managers or engineers to collaborate, too.

### Analysis & Gut

Sometimes I like to do a deep analysis with data in order to solve a problem or make a decision. Sometimes I like to go with my gut. If it's an area where I have a lot of hands on experience from my career, I will usually go with my gut. If it's an area where data will keep us from over-indexing on the loudest opinoins, I will use data.

I want a balance here, though. I've worked in companies where everything is based on gut and companies where no decision can be made without data. My experience is that both of these extremes tend to produce the wrong outcomes. In the first case, I've been bad decisions around product and company strategy. In the second, I've seen organizations that are unable to make even the most basic decisions without analysis, which slows decision making down. 

I will strive for a balance. I will ask you to do the same.

## Ok, what is something most people don't know about me?

You made it this far. So here are a couple of nuggets.

1. I've been airborne in a car. Twice. As a teenager. Both times were brief but memorable.
2. I've been electrocuted multiple times. It's a hazard of playing with electronics. The worst was a 10,000 volt HeNe laser power supply. I'm not sure how that didn't kill me. I'm a lot more careful now! Fun fact: being shocked by AC feels different than being shocked by DC. It's a "tickle" vs. a "zap" in case you were wondering. 
3. I journal constantly. Journalling is one of the ways I think and process things.
4. I sing a lot. I'm not that great, but I love music. 
5. I wanted to be a mad scientist inventor as a kid. I read books about Tesla and Edison and dreamed about building labs for investing. I've actually kind of done this in real life, but I have more plans. :evil-laughter:

# Life Philosophy: Let The Mountain Take You

I love to ski, and I have a philosophy of life to share with you as an analogy.

*When you first learn to ski or snowboard, you fight the mountain. A beginner skier snowplows. A beginner snow boarder rides the back end of the board.*

*Then as skiers and boarders learn to turn, they being carving wide turns to control speed and descent, and they meander down slowly. This takes a lot of energy because they're still working against the mountain.*

*The turning point for a skier or boarder is when you learn to let go...when you learn to stop fighting the mountain. This is the point when you've developed enough skill that you can let go and let the mountain take you. You're still carving and picking a line, but it takes much less physical exertion. You aren't fighting. You're going where the mountain wants you to go.*

*Sometimes it's faster than you're comfortable with. Sometimes your skis or board lose contact with the snow. Sometimes you're flat out in the air. Sometimes for a moment you feel scared and out of control.*

*But when you get to the bottom, you feel the adrenaline rush of having let nature take hold of you for just a moment and show you what it feels like to fly.*

*This is life. We have to go beyond the point of comfort and security. We have to be scared in order to grow.*

**So, let the mountain take you.**
